For Daily use ETL to Table

#------------------------------#
# TO DO:
# - Build a script to take in any csv files for GTC orders
# - Process the data into a pandas dataframe
# - Clean the data 
#    - Including dropping unneeded columns
#
# - Two options:
#       1. Store the data in a sqlite database
#           - Store the data in a temp sqlite table (table is dropped at start of process)
#           - Pull the data for daily use table
#           - export the retrieved data in a format that is easy to read
#           - Send the export file to email address
#       2. Transform pandas dataframe into a daily use table
#           - export the data in a format that is easy to read
#           - Send the export file to email address
#
# - Add logging to the process
# - Add error handling to the process
# - Automaticaly delete the csv files at the end of the process (handeled in anohter script)
#
# - Options for automatization:
# -     1. Automat the process to run when new csv files are saved to input folder
# -     2. Automat the process to run when csv files are sent to email address
# -     3. Look into a website that allow for uploading a CSV file and return formated xlsx file to download
